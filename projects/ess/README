Easy Service Scanner v0.3.4 by Peter Postma <peter@webdeveloping.nl>

This is a simple program for testing network services.
It features IPv6 support, banner grabbing, anonymous ftp scan, ident scanning,
mail relaying test and it has support for round robin dns entry's.


To compile the program:
# make

You can specify -DIPV4_DEFAULT to use IPv4 only by default.
See the Makefile for an example.
If you're on Solaris then you must uncomment the LIBS line before doing make.

If you want to install the program to /usr/local/bin then simply do
# make install


Usage: ./ess [options] hostname port
Options:
  -4      Force the use of IPv4 only.
  -6      Force the use of IPv6 only.
  -a      When resolved to multiple addresses, scan them all.
  -b      Grab the banner from an open port.
  -f      Anonymous FTP scan, checks if the server allows anonymous logins.
  -i      Ident scan, queries ident/auth (port 113) and tries to get the
          identity of the service we're connecting to.
  -n      Don't try to resolve addresses.
  -q      Be quiet. Don't output anything to stdout.
  -r      Mail Relay test, performs a simple test to check for open-relay.
          Use twice for an extensive open-relay test.
  -v      Be verbose. It's use is recommended.


The program returns several exit codes (described below) which 
makes the program useful to integrate in shell scripts or automated tasks.

Exit codes:
   0 - port is open (or service allowed)
   1 - port is closed (or service denied)
   2 - request timed out (or unable to login)
  64 - invalid arguments/flags
  65 - invalid combination of flags
  70 - unknown error (this should never happen)
  99 - code when option -V is used
 128 - bad address/service or some other error which causes
       the address/name resolve functions to fail
 255 - error in a socket operation (write, read, getsockname, etc...)
