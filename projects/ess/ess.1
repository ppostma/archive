.SH SYNOPSIS

.IR hostname/ip
.IR port/service
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ess
is a small program for testing TCP network services and daemons.
.PP
The program can test for anonymous ftp logins, mail relay (20 different tests),
reverse ident scan and open proxy (http, socks) test.
It supports IPv6 out of the box.
Note that this program is not a portscanner but only a small tool for testing
a single port/service.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-4
Force the use of IPv4 only.
.TP
.B \-6
Force the use of IPv6 only.
.TP
.B \-a
When the supplied hostname resolves to multiple addresses then scan
all of them.
.TP
.B \-b
Get the banner from an open port.
Special characters will be translated so you can read them.
.TP
.B \-f
Anonymous FTP scan, checks if the FTP server allows anonymous logins.
You don't have to specify a port here as port 21 will be used by default.
You may override this by specifying another port.
.TP
.B \-i
Ident scan, queries ident/auth (port 113) and tries to get the identity of
the service we're connecting to.
This will not work when the server or client is behind a NAT router.
.TP
.B \-n
If you've compiled
.I ess
with -DRESOLVE:
Don't try to resolve addresses to names.
Compiled without -DRESOLVE:
Try resolve addresses to names.
.TP
.B \-p \fItype\fP
Open proxy test, checks if the proxy server allows connections.
The \fItype\fP argument can be either \fBhttp\fP or \fBsocks\fP.
.TP
.B \-q
Be quiet.
Don't output anything to stdout.
.TP
.B \-r
Mail relay test.
Performs a simple test to check for open\-relay.
If you use this option twice then
.I ess
will perform an extensive check (20 different tests).
You don't have to specify a port here as port 25 will be used by default.
You may override this by specifying another port.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout\fP
Specify a timeout in milliseconds, used when connecting to a service.
The default timeout is 3000 milliseconds.
.TP
.B \-v
Be verbose.
Its use is recommended, especially with the \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-r\fP flags.
.SH EXIT CODES
The program returns several exit codes which might make it useful to
integrate in shell scripts or automated tasks.
Here are the codes:
.TP 10
.B 0
Port is open (or service access allowed).
.TP
.B 1
Port is closed (or service access denied).
.TP
.B 2
Request timed out (or unable to login at the service).
.TP
.B 64
Invalid arguments/flags.
.TP
.B 65
Invalid combination of flags.
.TP
.B 70
Unknown error (this should never happen).
.TP
.B 99
Code when option \fB\-V\fP is used.
.TP
.B 128
Bad address/service or some other error which causes
the address/name resolve functions to fail.
.TP
.B 255
Eror in socket operation (send, recv, getsockname, ...)
or malloc failure.
