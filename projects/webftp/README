WebFTP client v0.8 by Peter Postma <peter@webdeveloping.nl>

1. Installation:

Change the server ip in conf.php.
That's all :-)


2. Notes:

This script has been tested and runs succesfull on the following FTP servers:

 - proftpd on FreeBSD
 - proftpd on Linux
 - default ftpd on FreeBSD
 - default ftpd on NetBSD
 - default ftpd on OpenBSD

Any Microsoft Windows FTP server will not work.

Make sure you've compiled PHP with "--enable-ftp" otherwise this script will
not function. You can check this with phpinfo();

Do not use this client with large file tranfers, it's too unreliable.

If uploads don't work then the value "file_uploads" in php.ini 
is probably set to "off". Set this to "on" to enable uploads.

If you've problems with uploading files >2MB then change the setting
"upload_max_filesize" to higher value.


3. Todo:
 - dir.php needs redesign, this one sucks
 - fix: symlinks
 - icons: need a new chmod icon, maybe delete icon too
 - add: owner & group?
 - fix: upload method isn't really correct
