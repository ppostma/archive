Playlist2HTML v0.6.2 by Peter Postma <peter@webdeveloping.nl>

With this program you can convert your M3U playlist files to HTML files.

Typ 'make' to compile the program.
The Makefile will use the GNU C++ compiler (g++) by default.

The use is quite easy:
# ./playlist yourlist.m3u > yourhtmlfile.html
