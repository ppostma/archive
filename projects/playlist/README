Playlist2HTML v0.6 by Peter Postma <peter@webdeveloping.nl>

With this program you can convert your M3U playlist files to HTML files.

The use is quite easy:
 - Windows: playlist yourlist.m3u > yourhtmlfile.html
 - Unix: ./playlist yourlist.m3u > yourhtmlfile.html

On Unix you first need to compile the program.
To do this, you need a C++ Compiler. Typ 'make' to start the compiling
process. The makefile will use the GNU C++ compiler (g++) by default.

The Windows executable is compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.
